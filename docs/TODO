*	tune PV1/2/3 loads, add loads for interlagos and GPUs

*	Be able to map temperatures. Also needs to be able to locate specific temps to do this.

*	Add more detailed logging. Idea is to print this detailed report to a file.

*	Add instruentation to the loads, as with Confidence.

*	Be able to compile and run on other operating systems than Linux.

*	Simple metrics.

*	Have a library of high power-draw loads.

*	Have adaptive loading.

*	Set the monitor to also watch GPU temps, fan speeds, memory usage, and other motherboard temps such as memory.

*	PAPI counters for memory heirarchy, etc.

*	Disk iops & bandwidth.

*	Generalize the program. Don't rely on ACPI for temperatures, have backups if libraries for the plans aren't there (CBLAS, FFTW, etc.), etc.

*	Have an orthogonal basis set of loads to examine power impact of stressing an individual component.

*	Check and/or correctly determine all buffer sizes!
